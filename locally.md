# Installing tools locally
If for any reason you need to install locally (*no having sudo privilages*) here are some ways to do it.

## Installing using a prefix
Most of the program will need to be configure before installing. In the configuration specify where to install the program.  

1- Specify the PATH to install the program.  
```bash
./configure --prefix=/path/you/want/the/program
```  

2- Now we need to run the make command.  
```bash  
make  
```  

3- Mow run maek install to install the program in our desire PATH.  
```bash
make install
```  

Programs are install in the PATH specify in the configure step (#1).  

4- (OPTIONAL) You can them edit your `.bashrc` to add the location of the program to your PATH.   

**Other options**
- Go to the folder and run the program.      
```bash
cd /path/of/the/program  
```   
```bash
./program
```  

- Call the program from the folder you are working on.  
```bash
./path/of/the/program/program_name
```  

- Create a temporary variable for the program (*e.g.* for using in a script).  
```bash
myprogram=/path/of/the/program/program_name
```   
Now when you type the name of your variable using a `$` before the name the program will run.   
```bash
$myprogram
```  
Note: This variable is not going to be available save for future session. If you log out and in you will not have it anymore.  

## Using conda  
Directly from their [webpage](https://conda.io/docs/)
"Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux."  

It is a very useful tool, specially becasue you can use conda to install locally. Is that the case, "why I need to bother in learning how to install locally" you may say. Simply, not all the programs are in conda. However, you will see that the common are available and constant√∂y more programs are added.    

Here we are not going to explain how to install conda since the documentation provided in their page is very detailed and step by step. We are going to show  you how install programs when  you already have conda (or miniconda).  Here is a conda [cheat sheet](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) for reference too.  

1- Check in the [repositories](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/repo) if your program is available.
