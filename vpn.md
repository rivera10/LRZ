### MAc Installation
- VPN with Mac OS X
Cisco VPN Client for Mac OS
System requirements:
- OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)

If there are any problems with the AnyConnect client, use the built-in client. A profile for this client is available on the download page.

- OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) , OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) , OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) OS X 10.7 (Lion)

Please use the AnyConnect client ( http://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpn/anyconnect/ ).

- Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

- Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) has a built-in Cisco IPsec client. A profile for this client is available on the download page.

- Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and older:

The Cisco VPN client only runs on the operating system version of Mac OS X 10.1.5. Under the apple there is the menu item About this Mac , with which one can query the version of Mac OS X. For users who still only use Mac OS 9, there is no more client (There was a client of Netlock for $ 114 (as of 08-2003))

How do I get the VPN client?
The Cisco VPN client and the required lrz.pcf profile can be downloaded from the Leibniz Data Center web server at the following URL: [https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpnclient/] . On this page you have to authenticate yourself with a valid identifier (eg LRZ, MyTUM, CamusLMU) and then get to the download page. Since the installation program is about 14 megabytes in size, we recommend a fast internet connection (estimated download times 56k: 30 min, ISDN: 15 min, DSL: 2 min).
