- Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) has a built-in Cisco IPsec client. A profile for this client is available on the [download](https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpnclient)page.

- Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and older:

The Cisco VPN client only runs on the operating system version of Mac OS X 10.1.5. Under the apple there is the menu item About this Mac , with which one can query the version of Mac OS X. For users who still only use Mac OS 9, there is no more client (There was a client of Netlock for $ 114 (as of 08-2003))  

How do I get the VPN client?  
The Cisco VPN client and the required lrz.pcf profile can be downloaded from the Leibniz Data Center web server at the following URL: [https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpnclient/] . On this page you have to authenticate yourself with a valid identifier (eg LRZ, MyTUM, CamusLMU) and then get to the download page. Since the installation program is about 14 megabytes in size, we recommend a fast internet connection (estimated download times 56k: 30 min, ISDN: 15 min, DSL: 2 min).  

**Installation of the VPN client:**

## Windows Installation
**VPN (IPsec) under Windows**
The Cisco VPN client program for Windows can be installed on the Windows 98, 98SE, ME, NT4 (SP6a), 2000, XP, Vista, and Windows 7 (32-bit) systems only. For 64-bit systems, only the [Anyconnect client](https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpn/anyconnect/) can be used. For systems with less than 256 MB of main memory, please use version 4.0.5C.

**Download the client software**
Enter your user ID and password on the https://www.lrz.de/services/netz/mobil/vpnclient page and then click on the download page . Click on the button Windows on the appearing page . Select a directory, eg C: \ tmp and click Save . Then download the LRZ profile for an existing client from the same page (penultimate link on the page), eg save the file lrz.pcf to C: \ tmp.

**Installation**
Close (really) all other running applications, the installation of the client goes deeper into the system than other program installations. Disruptions are pretty easy here.  

Start the Windows Explorer and unpack the file vpnclient-win-msi-5.0.03.0530-k9.exe (name different for other versions) by double-clicking on the file name. Administrator rights are required for the installation. After unpacking the installation starts automatically.  

**Attention: Leave the default installation directory, a change can lead to a faulty installation.**  

Confirm the next windows with Next or Yes . After the appearance and disappearance of some other windows finally comes the request to restart the computer.
