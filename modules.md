# Using modules in a cluster
Some, if not the majority of the supercomputing centers, install programs and make them available by modules. This is done specially so resource management programs could allocate computational tasks and run the programs without crashing the server (*e.g.* [PBS](https://www.pbspro.org/), [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/)).
